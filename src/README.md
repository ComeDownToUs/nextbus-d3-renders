To run simply enter `gulp` from the root director

This is a gulp boilerplate which:
1. converts and merges sass files into one css file
2. lints and merges js files into one, also runs tests if there are any
3. commits reloads when changes are applied to the root sass and css folders, and html files in the app directory
